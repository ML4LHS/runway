# runway

The goal of runway is to generate statistics and plots to calculate discrimination, calibration, and decision curves for prediction models.

## Why is it called runway?

Because you can use it to visually compare models.

Sometimes your models look quite different.

Other times your models look the same...

## Installation

You can install `runway` from GitHub with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('ML4LHS/runway')
```

## Load the package

First, load the package.

```{r}
library(runway)
```

## Sample datasets

Runway comes with two sample datasets.

```{r}
data(single_model_dataset)
head(single_model_dataset)

data(multi_model_dataset)
head(multi_model_dataset)
```


## Threshold-performance plot (single model)

```{r}
threshperf_plot(single_model_dataset,
                outcome = 'outcomes',
                prediction = 'predictions')
```


## Threshold-performance plot (multiple models)

```{r}
threshperf_plot_multi(multi_model_dataset,
                      outcome = 'outcomes',
                      prediction = 'predictions',
                      model = 'model_name')
```


## Calibration plot (single model)

```{r}
cal_plot(single_model_dataset,
         outcome = 'outcomes', 
         prediction = 'predictions',
         n_bins = 5)
```


## Calibration plot (multiple models)

```{r}
cal_plot_multi(multi_model_dataset,
         outcome = 'outcomes',
         prediction = 'predictions',
         model = 'model_name',
         n_bins = 5)
```
